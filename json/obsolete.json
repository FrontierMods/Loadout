        "assumed to be Trijicon ACOG sight with a mount for RMR",
        "it's a popular model in films and video games, and may be favored over offset sights by some shooters",
        "effectively replaced with giving the fleshed-out ACOG a separate mount for RMR"
      ],
      "rifle_scope_high_end_mount": ["replaced with extra mounts"],
      "u_shotgun": [
        "this one appears to be pure fiction and is thus disposed with",
        "effectively replaced by the 'not-Masterkey' underbarrel shotgun: the latter is more compact, holds more rounds, and is (presumably) easier to shoot"
      ],
      "stabilizer": [
        "gyroscopic stabilizers became a thing in 2020, having been tested for the Iron Man suit by the US Army",
        "by the looks of it, they weren't very ergonomic for use in the field",
        "perhaps an expansion could handle it as a fully-developed idea with civilian options available"
      ],
      "sights_mount_launcher": [
        "attaching a plastic mount with screws only makes sense for a small number of launchers",
        "e.g. M79 (has wooden stock grip to drill into), China Lake launcher (likewise)",
        "even then, their construction makes the installation likely to be flimsy",
        "beyond that, research yields no authentic attempts at installing anything remotely similar"
      ],
      "gun_crossbow": [
        "this item appears to be pure fiction",
        "besides, mounting a crossbow powerful-enough to be effective under the barrel (let alone on a side rail) of a rifle would likely make the gun (1) much too heavy, (2) much too unwieldy (due to balance issues), (3) not fit into any possible holster or case"
      ],
      "masterkey": [
        "this attachment has been a rare issue to military units in real life",
        "at this stage, it is obsolete and beyond outdated, having been replaced (and in greater numbers) by M26-MASS"

      ],
      "sights_mount_pistol": [
        "this attachment makes no sense, as it's meant to be a generic sights rail but attached to pistols",
        "while attachments for this exist aplenty on the market, they make no sense in the game without modifying every single pistol",
        "most of these attachments slot into the underbarrel rail, and bend around the slide to provide an upper rail",
        "pistols that have an underbarrel rail slot generally also have a sights slot already",
        "the alternative is mounts which replace rear sights, which we don't model because we hate components disappearing into the ether",
        "even those would be different for each sight footprint, and would only take in compact reflex sights"

        "one of those 'replace thing into the ether' thing we're trying to avoid"
      ],
      "waterproof_gunmod": [
        "one of those 'replace thing into the ether' thing we're trying to avoid",

      "*_mod": [
        "any sort of modification that makes an item attachable to a wider variety of items makes no sense, unless it's an adaptation of a niche mod and/or for a niche platform",
        "even then, it must be subject to consideration",
        "most modern firearms feature Picatinny rails, which by default accept any compatible equipment",
        "and in case of muzzle devices, the threads they mount onto are standardized",
        "for muzzle devices, worth noting that one cannot attach any device on any thread:",
        "instead, most devices are made for a range of threads common on their target platform(s)",
        "the only consideration for rail devices (top, side, and bottom) is the amount of space they take on the rail, which will hopefully get implemented by the next stable release"
