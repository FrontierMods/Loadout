When prone or standing against an obstacle of sufficient height, such a bipod can be used to stabilize the gun, making aiming and recoil management significantly easier.  The two obvious disadvantages to attaching a bipod is weight and extra volume.  For these reasons, some shooters prefer to carry their bipod in a gun bag or a specialized MOLLE pocket, and attach it in the field when necessary.  <variant_black>",
