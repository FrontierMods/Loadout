# Roadmap

## Current

### v2.1

- [ ] **adjustable-length suppressors**
  - for the models that do support it
- [ ] **magazine modding**
  - [ ] conventional STANAG magazines
  - [ ] Glock magazines
  - extended base plates to improve magazine capacity
  - carabiner adapters (aka ranger plates)
  - magazine decoration?
  - labels and markings?

## In Progress

### v2.0

- [ ] **overhaul contents of the mod**
  - remove some of the gunmods
    - primarily those with overlapping domains or effects that are too similar
  - replace others with streamlined versions
    - no more three-part compact suppressor
  - variantize each attachment
    - this should allow players who aren't tacticool-savvy to enjoy Armory as well
- [ ] **modern Army rifle attachments**
  - [ ] SIG Sauer TANGO6T variable scope
  - [ ] Aimpoint CompM4 red dot sight
  - [ ] AN/PSQ-23 laser sight/rangefinder
